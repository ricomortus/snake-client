# Snake Client Project

This is a single player snake game! It's an easier version of the traditional snake game as you can control how stop and start the movement.

This is a single player version!

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.

## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
